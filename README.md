Cash demand in ATMs require accurate prediction which is no different than in other vending machines. The only difference is the product which is cash needs to be replenished for a priory set period of time. If the forecast is wrong, it induces a considerable amount of costs. In the case of high forecast and high unused cash stored in the ATM incur costs to the bank. The bank pays different re-filling costs depending on its policy with the money transportation company. Banks normally pay a significant amount of fixed fees for the re-filling, additional extra cost for the transportation with security arrangement.
Some banks might store 40% more cash in ATMs than the actual demand and banks might have thousands of nationwide ATMs. Therefore, a small optimization in business operations would contribute to high earnings.
